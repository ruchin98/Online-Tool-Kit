------------------MongoDB------Up's:

NoSQL - supports BSON(JSON) docs. If you deal with a lot of textual data and output in the form of JSON, Yes It is for you
Schema-less: eg. We crawl multiple different websites and parse the data to JSON. Every website will give different information(fields) compared to others. Schema-less helps to store in a hassle free
Insert and update extreme fast (Daily millions of data changes)
Easy Installation, Replication(replica sets) and scaling (sharding)

-----------------MongoDB------Down’s

Single Master Architecture: The write can happen over only one node, however, the read can happen in multiple slaves
Parent Organisation of MongoDB is not open source
Stability and Crashing: When I started using ,very often we will have server crash however in the recent upgrades We haven’t felt.
Aggregation is a memory consuming operation
Initially, MongoDB Query language will be difficult
Recently, MongoDB introduced ACID compliant DB in its v4.0


----MongoDB-------Version 4.0 upwards-------------------------------------------------------------------------

. In version 4.0, MongoDB supports multi-document transactions on replica sets.
. In version 4.2, MongoDB introduces distributed transactions, which adds support for multi-document transactions on sharded clusters and incorporates the existing support for multi-document transactions on replica sets.

NOTE: To use transactions on MongoDB 4.2 deployments (replica sets and sharded clusters), clients must use MongoDB drivers updated for MongoDB 4.2.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4 with feature compatibility version (fcv) "4.4", you can create collections and indexes inside a multi-document transaction unless the transaction is a cross-shard write transaction. With "4.2" or less, operations that affect the database catalog, such as creating or dropping a collection or an index, are disallowed in transactions.
